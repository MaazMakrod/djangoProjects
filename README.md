This is a CRUD application that I built to host ads. All of the data is stored in a MySQL database and video demo can be found [here](https://youtu.be/nUGVMTMHgD4)

This application allows a user to login either locally or through social authentication using GitHub, 'favorite' ads, search for specific ads, and comment on specific ads.
